_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has folders with code for each of the videos in the course. You can see the examples for each video in the corresponding folder.

The SQL Careers Assessment.pdf document is a copy of the Assessment you will take inside of the LinkedIn Learning video platform after the first chapter. The Skills Inventory Worksheet.pdf is for you to fill out when working through the course.

The folders are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the folder named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.
