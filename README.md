## Instructions
This repository has folders with code for each of the videos in the course. You can see the examples for each video in the corresponding folder.

The folders are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the folder named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.

The [SQL Careers Assessment.pdf](https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/finding-new-career-paths-with-sql-2881262/blob/main/SQL%20Careers%20Assessment.pdf) document is a copy of the Assessment/Chapter Quiz you will take inside of the LinkedIn Learning video platform after the first chapter. The [Skills Inventory Worksheet.pdf](https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/finding-new-career-paths-with-sql-2881262/blob/main/Skills%20Inventory%20Worksheet.pdf) is for you to fill out while working through the course.
